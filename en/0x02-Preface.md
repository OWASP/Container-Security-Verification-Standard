# Preface

Welcome to the Container Security Verification Standard (CSVS) version 0.1. The CSVS is a community-effort to establish a framework of security requirements and controls that focus on normalizing the functional and non-functional security controls required when designing, developing and testing container-based solutions with a focus on Docker.

We expect that there will most likely never be 100% agreement on this standard. Risk analysis is always subjective to some extent, which creates a challenge when attempting to generalize in a one size fits all standard. We're always happy to hear your feedback and re-evaluate the requirements.
